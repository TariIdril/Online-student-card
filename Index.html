            <h2>About me</h2>
            <H3> Why did you do IronHack ?</H3>
            <p>
              I have studied quite a few thing before coming to Iron Hack, but I
              always ended up not finishing because I love learning new things
              but studying is not for me. I am a worker, I have worked since I
              was 15, so Iron Hack was an opportunity to learn something new
              that I liked, in a fast and challenging way and also gave me the
              opportunity to find a versatile job like UX/UI Designer.

            <h3>What do you look for in a company culture?</h3>
            <p>
              I am looking for an innovative and tolerant workplace, where
              creativity and problem solving are our priorities but also where
              changing and improving are even more important.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Superpower and why ?</h3>
          <p>
            My gaming hobby has made my mind flexible and adaptive, so I learn
            new things and adapt to new situations very quickly.
